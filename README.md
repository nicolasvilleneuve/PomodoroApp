The following app is very straight forward. 
You simply run the code, which will in turn, launch a GUI. 
At the center of the GUI is a timer, which will begin a timer, counting down from 25 minutes.
After the 25 minutes, it will start a 5 minute 'Short Break' timer, intended for you to follow and take a short break. 
After the 'Short Break', another 25 minute break will initiate. 
This process will repeat 4 times, until you reach a 'Long Break' of 20 minutes. 

For more information on the Pomodoro Technique, you may refer to the following wikipedia entry:

Should you notice any problems with this code, please feel free to let me know. 
I hope it helps your productivity as much as it has helped mine.
